      "q1": "What percentage of AI-generated citations are fake?",
      "a1": "Studies show that 15-30% of citations generated by AI language models like ChatGPT are completely fabricated. Another 20-30% may contain errors such as wrong page numbers or publication dates.",
      "q2": "How does SwanRef verify citations?",
      "a2": "SwanRef checks each citation against multiple academic databases including CrossRef (150M+ papers), Google Scholar, and direct publisher databases. We use pattern matching to identify common AI hallucination signatures.",
      "q3": "Is SwanRef really free?",
      "a3": "Yes, SwanRef is completely free for academic use. No registration required, no hidden fees, no usage limits. We believe academic integrity tools should be accessible to all students and researchers.",
      "q4": "Can I verify citations in languages other than English?",
      "a4": "Currently, SwanRef primarily supports English-language citations. However, our interface is available in 8 languages, and we're working on expanding citation verification to other languages."
