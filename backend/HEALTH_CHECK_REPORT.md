# DetectReference Project Health Check Report

Generated on: 2025-07-07

## Executive Summary

The DetectReference project is a reference verification system with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The overall health is moderate with several areas requiring attention, particularly around production readiness, security, and code cleanliness.

## Critical Issues ðŸ”´

### 1. Security Concerns
- **API Keys exposed in .env file**: The `.env` file contains actual API keys that should not be committed to version control
  - GEMINI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY, and GOOGLE_CSE_ID are exposed
  - Recommendation: Use `.env.example` with placeholder values and add `.env` to `.gitignore`

### 2. Console.log Statements in Production Code
- **24 files** contain console.log statements that should be removed:
  - Core services: `geminiServiceAxios.js`, `googleSearchService.js`, `crossrefService.js`
  - Controllers: `verifyController.js`, `verifyControllerSSE.js`, `formatController.js`
  - Main entry point: `src/index.js`
  - Recommendation: Replace with proper logging library (e.g., winston, pino)

### 3. Test Files in Source Directory
- Test files found in production source directory:
  - `src/services/googleSearch.test.js`
  - `src/services/geminiServiceAxios.test.js`
  - `src/services/cacheService.test.js`
  - Recommendation: Move all test files to the `tests/` directory

## Moderate Issues ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Hardcoded Values
- Frontend Vite config has hardcoded backend URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- Multiple test files contain hardcoded URLs
- Recommendation: Use environment variables for all URLs and ports

### 2. Error Handling Inconsistency
- Some controllers use try-catch blocks while others rely on middleware
- Error messages are sometimes in Chinese, sometimes in English
- Recommendation: Standardize error handling approach and language

### 3. Environment Variables
- No validation for required environment variables
- Missing `.env.example` file for developers
- Recommendation: Add environment variable validation on startup

### 4. API Endpoint Consistency
- All endpoints are under `/api/` prefix which is good
- However, naming convention varies (kebab-case vs camelCase)
- Endpoints: `/verify-references`, `/verify-references-stream`, `/format-citations`

## Minor Issues ðŸŸ¢

### 1. Package Dependencies
- Both frontend and backend have minimal dependencies (good)
- Version ranges are specified appropriately
- No obvious security vulnerabilities in listed packages

### 2. Project Structure
- Generally follows the recommended structure from CLAUDE.md
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Proper use of controllers, services, and routes

### 3. Build Scripts
- Both frontend and backend have appropriate npm scripts
- Development and production scripts are defined

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Remove API keys from version control**
   - Create `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Rotate all exposed API keys

2. **Remove console.log statements**
   - Replace with proper logging library
   - Set up log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

3. **Move test files out of src directory**
   - Consolidate all tests in the `tests/` directory
   - Update import paths accordingly

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Implement environment variable validation**
   - Check for required variables on startup
   - Provide clear error messages for missing variables

2. **Standardize error handling**
   - Create consistent error response format
   - Use a single language for error messages

3. **Add API documentation**
   - Document all endpoints with request/response examples
   - Consider using OpenAPI/Swagger

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. **Add comprehensive testing**
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend component tests

2. **Implement proper logging and monitoring**
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Request/response logging
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Add CI/CD pipeline**
   - Automated testing on push
   - Linting and code quality checks
   - Automated deployment process

## Code Quality Metrics

- **TODO/FIXME comments**: 0 found (good)
- **Console.log statements**: 24 files affected (needs cleanup)
- **Test coverage**: Limited (only a few test files present)
- **Documentation**: Basic README exists, but lacks API documentation
- **TypeScript**: Not used (consider migration for better type safety)

## Conclusion

The project has a solid foundation but needs attention to production readiness, particularly around security, logging, and testing. The most critical issue is the exposed API keys in version control, which should be addressed immediately.
