Title: I built a free tool to detect fake ChatGPT citations after my advisor caught one in my draft

Hey everyone,

Last month, I used ChatGPT to help find sources for my literature review. Everything looked legit until my advisor pointed out that one citation didn't exist. Turns out, ChatGPT had completely made it up.

After some research, I found that ~15% of AI-generated citations are fake. So I built a free tool that instantly verifies if references are real by checking CrossRef and Google Scholar.

It also formats citations in APA/MLA/Chicago/Harvard styles, which saves me tons of time.

The tool is at cite.alx37.com - completely free, no signup needed.

Hope this helps someone avoid the embarrassment I went through!

(Mods: I checked the rules and tools are allowed on Tool Thursday. Happy to remove if not appropriate)
